## Tips for Best Results

1. **Be specific**: "What did Sarah decide about the user dashboard?" is better than "What did Sarah say?"

2. **Include context**: "Why did we choose React over Vue for the frontend?" works better than "Why React?"

3. **Use names**: "What did John suggest for the API?" helps narrow down results

4. **Include timeframes**: "What did we decide in last week's meeting?" is more specific

5. **Ask about decisions**: Questions about decisions and conclusions work best

6. **Avoid real-time info**: Ethos searches history, not live data or future plans

## Expected Response Format

```
🧠 Ethos remembers:

We decided to use PostgreSQL for the database because it has better 
support for JSONB data types and full-text search capabilities. John 
suggested this on October 15th after comparing it with MongoDB.

## When Ethos Says "I Don't Know"

This means:
- The information wasn't discussed in indexed channels
- The keywords don't match any conversations
- The discussion happened before messages were indexed
- Try rephrasing with different terms
